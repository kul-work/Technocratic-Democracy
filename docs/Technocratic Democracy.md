# Technocratic Democracy

The "Technocratic Democracy" plan proposes reforming the political system to achieve more efficient and rational governance. It suggests replacing traditional politicians with specialists in various fields capable of making informed decisions for the common good.

The objective is to create a more functional democracy based on specialized knowledge and public consensus, thereby redefining the relationship between the governed and the governors.

Key Elements:

* The model aims to address the paradox between the "market model" and the "polis model".
* The new system combines elements of direct democracy with technocratic competence, seeking a balance between professional expertise and citizen participation.
* Referendums play a central role in validating legislative decisions and ensuring active public involvement in the decision-making process.
