# Criticism

## Simplistic and incomplete model

  Models aim to democratize decision-making but can be overly simplistic. They often overlook the complexities of societal issues, leading to ineffective policies that donâ€™t fully address diverse communities' needs.

## Does not avoid social engineering

  Modelling facilitates [social engineering](https://imgur.com/a/inginerie-sociala-nlyAg5e) by promoting specific narratives. This raises ethical concerns, as well-organized interest groups may dominate discussions, marginalizing less vocal segments and reinforcing existing power dynamics.

## Increased risk of _'voter fatigue'_

  Frequent participatory processes can lead to **voter fatigue**. When individuals are constantly asked to engage, they may feel overwhelmed and disengaged. This can result in lower participation rates and disillusionment with democratic processes.

## Risk of disorganization

  Risk of disorganization due to excessive participation. Increased participation can lead to chaos or even anarchy. Unstructured discussions often devolve into unproductive debates, especially on [social media](https://imgur.com/a/participatory-democracy-fail-zjGJOWO). Evenmore, popular political posts attract a mix of insightful and inflammatory comments, drowning out constructive dialogue.

## Challenges of Implementing Electronic Voting

  The model relies on technologies and methodologies that are not yet fully realized, such as electronic referendums. Despite significant technological penetration through smartphones and personal computers, implementing a national electronic voting system poses substantial challenges. These also include concerns about security, accessibility, and the integrity of the voting process.
