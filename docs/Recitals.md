## MOTIVATION STATEMENT

### Observations

* Western European democracy, adapted to the Euro-Atlantic space, has entered a self-destructive cycle, considering its usefulness to society at the end of the 20th century.
* The electoral process heavily depends on the media, which can be influenced by politicians.
* The representation of the population is weak; elected officials are often disconnected from voters. Representative democracy remains vulnerable to corruption.
* Power is concentrated in 2-3 major parties that make only minor rotations in decisions. These parties often represent the interests of economic players, frequently acting against the general interest for profit.
* Elections, whether national, local, or internal, can be manipulated through mass manipulation techniques that exploit various human biases.
* The legislative process is unwieldy and poorly coordinated with the executive branch, being overly bureaucratic and not automated.
* Laws are often adopted without adequate assessment of their societal impact. Defective laws are then difficult to correct, generating social tensions, and protests become the primary form of feedbackâ€”an aggressive self-regulation process.
* Global economic and political visions are fragmented and inconsistent. Governance focuses on short-term solutions.
* Incompetence remains a major disruptive factor, although it is on a clearly declining trend.

### Proposals

* Utilize technologies such as artificial intelligence, blockchain, smartphones, and mass computing to establish and track objectives.
* Introduce competency criteria at the legislative and decision-making levels by adopting a corporate model; ideally, a majority of the executive should be technocratized.
* Actively involve the population in the decision-making process while maintaining adequate representation within the state apparatus.
* Reduce political influence in execution and restructure it within society.

### Purpose

* Use the rules from Technocratic Democracy as specifications for creating a societal simulator (similar to The Sims), which integrates simplified models of citizens, macroeconomic systems, and public or private institutions, as well as interactions between them. Within this simulator, various legislative scenarios could be run and their impact on society analyzed, including the effects of events with significant social impact.

### Other Considerations

* TBD
