# Criticism

## Simplistic and incomplete model

  Models aim to democratize decision-making but can be overly simplistic. They often overlook the complexities of societal issues, leading to ineffective policies that donâ€™t fully address diverse communities' needs.

## Does not avoid social engineering

  Modelling facilitates [social engineering](https://imgur.com/a/inginerie-sociala-nlyAg5e) by promoting specific narratives. This raises ethical concerns, as well-organized interest groups may dominate discussions, marginalizing less vocal segments and reinforcing existing power dynamics.

## Increased risk of _'voter fatigue'_

  Frequent participatory processes can lead to **voter fatigue**. When individuals are constantly asked to engage, they may feel overwhelmed and disengaged. This can result in lower participation rates and disillusionment with democratic processes.

## Risk of disorganization

  Risk of disorganization due to excessive participation. Increased participation can lead to chaos or even anarchy. Unstructured discussions often devolve into unproductive debates, especially on [social media](https://imgur.com/a/participatory-democracy-fail-zjGJOWO). Evenmore, popular political posts attract a mix of insightful and inflammatory comments, drowning out constructive dialogue.
