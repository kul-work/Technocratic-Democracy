# Technocratic-Democracy
Draft basic rules for a democratic society based on technocracy.

Romania, a member state of the European Union (EU), currently operates under a semi-presidential representative democratic republic governance model. The proposed plan seeks to facilitate a transition towards a technocratic semi-direct democracy presidential republic.

While initially framed within Romania's context, these principles can be adapted to suit the transition for any Western democratic system.
