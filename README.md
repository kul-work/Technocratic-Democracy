# Technocratic Democracy

Basic outline of rules for a democratic society based on technocracy.

Romania, a member state of the European Union (EU), currently operates under a semi-presidential representative democratic republic governance model. The proposed plan seeks to facilitate a transition towards a technocratic semi-direct democracy presidential republic, using a system level modeling. Check the main [docs](https://github.com/kul-work/Technocratic-Democracy/blob/main/docs/Technocratic%20Democracy.md).

While initially framed within Romania's context, these rules can be adapted to suit the transition for any Western democratic system.
